		<p>I was not one of those people who grew up knowing what they wanted to do; it took time and effort along with a significant amount of trial and error to come to the conclusion that web development was where I belonged. I love to build and create. I love to look at something tangible and know I was instrumental in its creation. As a recent graduate of a fully immersive programming school, I have obtained a solid foundation in Ruby and JavaScript along with many other tools that have encouraged my further exploration. I’m excited for an opportunity to put these newly obtained skills to use in an environment that fosters growth and continued learning.I was not one of those people who grew up knowing what they wanted to do; it took time and effort along with a significant amount of trial and error to come to the conclusion that web development was where I belonged.
